\section{Including figures in your report}


You can insert figures such as Figure \ref{fig:intro_system}. The \verb|\ref{...}|-command will search for an item somewhere in your report that contains a \verb|\label{...}| with the same description. Try to always use high-quality images like .pdf or .eps. In Matlab, you can choose to save a figure as one of these file types instead of .jpg or .png.


\begin{figure}[H] % The [H]-command (here) makes sure that lateX places the figure where you put this piece of code. If you want LateX to decide where the figure will be, [H] can be omitted.
